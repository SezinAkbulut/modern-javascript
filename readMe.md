# Instructions:

This project can only run with a certain api + it's key.

We have to create a new (personal) key first before we can continue on this exercise!

## Create account on WeatherAPI

Go to [this web page](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

1. Create an account or login.
2. Find your api key in your dashboard:

## Create new files in your own project!

1. Create a `config.js` file with this code and paste your key in this file:
   * ```js
      const Data = {
        key : "45s64fdgs_Your_Key_dgfdfgq5gsg"
      }
      export default Data;
      ```
   This file is used to store keys and other types of sensible data you don't want to share publicly

   Know that once something is pushed to github it is not possible to remove it from the history (which means that someone will always be able to find that data back). The best option if you accidentally pushed sensible data on github, is to change the data itself (e.g. regenerating a new api key)
2. Create a `.gitignore` file in which we will mention all the files we **don't** want to push to Github:
   * ```
      config.js // To hide any confidential keys
      .idea // Depending on your IDE
      .vscode // Depending on your IDE
      .DS_Store // OS specific files (this one if for Mac)
      ```
## Start

Go back to [Day 1](../Part1-Refactor) and continue the exercise!# modern-javascript
